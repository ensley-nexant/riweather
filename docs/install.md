# Installation

## With pip

```shell
pip install riweather
```

The basic installation method does not install the packages required for plotting
stations with [`riweather.plot_stations`][]. If you want to make plots, install the
optional `plots` dependencies:

```shell
pip install riweather[plots]
```
